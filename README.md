# traderManager

**traderManager** is a Python script designed to provide easier management of the text files used in the Trader DayZ mod. In the future, we plan to provide an executable (`traderManager.exe`) for direct use. However, for now, you can run the script by starting the `main.py` file within Python 3.

The script simplifies the process of managing trader files by offering a user-friendly interface. It allows users to open and edit item information, update prices, modify categories and classes, and more. With **traderManager**, traders in the DayZ mod can efficiently manage their trading systems, saving time and effort.
